# Overview

Xyter is a privacy-focused bot - by making a lot of features opt-in and can easily be enabled/disabled by server owners. We are not and will never be one of those who makes proprietary code and making money out of it, we are happily accepting donations to make Xyter even better. And of course, you can self-host this bot or use our cloud instance if you want. We are happily helping you setting up your own instance and we provide same support regardless of if you self-host it or if we host it.

[Installation](#installation) is easy, bot is only supported officially when hosted on **Linux**, if you don't have much Linux knowledge we are happy to help you out on our [Discord server](https://discord.zyner.org)! When you have installed the bot you manage settings from within Discord aside from global settings.

**The default set of modules includes and is not limited to:**

- Credits (balance,gift,top,work including administrative commands such as give,take,set,transfer)
- Counters (allows you to create channels that only allows a specific word to be sent, user needs to wait until someone else has sent before sending it again)
- Fun (currently only includes meme)
- Shop (allows users to purchase with their credits, custom roles in the discord server and server hosting via [Controlpanel.gg](https://controlpanel.gg) if the server has enabled and is hosting their own hosting solution)
- Moderation (currently only includes a prune command, this is because we don't want to implement more damaging commands yet until we have a better solution for permissions)
- Reputation (allows users to give each other a reputation anonymously, this is global which means all users will have their reputation shown across all server the bot instance is connected to)

**Additionally, other [commands](https://xyter.zyner.org/docs/commands) can easily be found on our documentation site.**
